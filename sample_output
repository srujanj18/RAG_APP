C:\Users\sruja\OneDrive\Documents\RAG\ready_tensor_pubs\ready_tensor_bot.py:33: LangChainDeprecationWarning: The class `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` was deprecated in LangChain 0.2.2 and will be removed in 1.0. An updated version of the class exists in the :class:`~langchain-huggingface package and should be used instead. To use it run `pip install -U :class:`~langchain-huggingface` and import as `from :class:`~langchain_huggingface import HuggingFaceEmbeddings``.
